From The Yorker
Entertaini ng … [Mullis is] usefully cranky and combative, raising provocative questions about received truths from the scientific establishment.
From Chicago Sun-Times
One of the most unusual scientists of our times, a man who would be a joy to put under a microscope.
From Andrew Weil, M.D.
In this entertaining romp through diverse fields of inquiry, [Mullis] displays the openmindedness, eccentricity, brilliance, and general curmudgeonliness that make him the colorful chracter he is. His stories are engaging, informative, and fun.
